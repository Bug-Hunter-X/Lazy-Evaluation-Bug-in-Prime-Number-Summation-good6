This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Haskell code that arises from the interaction of lazy evaluation, infinite lists, and the `sum` function.  The `primes` function generates an infinite list of prime numbers. The `main` function attempts to calculate the sum of the first 10 primes using `take 10` and `sum`.  However, depending on the Haskell compiler's optimizations, this might lead to non-termination or unexpected results.  The solution showcases how to modify the code for guaranteed termination and correct output.
