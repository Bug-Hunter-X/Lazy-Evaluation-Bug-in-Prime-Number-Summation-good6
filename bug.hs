This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and infinite lists. The function `primes` generates an infinite list of prime numbers, but the way `take 10` and `sum` interact might lead to unexpected behavior or non-termination, depending on the Haskell implementation and optimization strategies.

```haskell
primes :: [Integer]
primes = sieve [2..] 
  where
    sieve (p:xs) = p : sieve [x | x <- xs, x `mod` p /= 0]

main :: IO ()
main = print $ sum (take 10 primes)
```
